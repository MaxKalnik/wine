      | RewardExpert started by accessing the Permitted Wine Producers Database provided by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Trade Bureau and compiling a comprehensive list of all wineries and vineyards in the U.S. as of March 2018. Then, we calculated a total number of wineries in each three-digit zip code area and computed the number of wineries per capita using U.S. Census Bureau population data. We obtained a data set comprising 2.02 million wine reviews scraped from CellarTracker by researchers at Stanford University. We cross-referenced winery ownership and operational names against the wine review data setâ€™s wine name field and calculated average ratings for each winery. We then calculated an average rating for all wineries within each three-digit zip code area.

      | Our ranking was calculated on the basis of wineries per capita (single weight) and average wine rating (triple weight), both expressed as a percentile ranking.
